Laboratory Schedule Management System (which will from hereby be referenced as LSMS) is
an important aspect in laboratory management and organization in general. LSMS manages the
access to the laboratory room and resources inside. It keeps tracks of who is in the laboratory, for
what period of time and all records of repair and maintenance. It is a simplified way of
controlling usage and monitoring access of authorized and all intruderâ€™s that might attempt to use
the laboratory.
